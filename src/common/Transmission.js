      <h3>How is COVID-19 transmitted?</h3>
      <p>
        COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the primary transmission route is
        through person-to- person contact and through direct contact with
        respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or
        sneezes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses
        being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot
        multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most recent advice from the WHO3 is that current evidence indicates
        that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through
        respiratory droplets (formed on coughing or sneezing) and by fomites.
        The virus can spread directly from person-to-person when a COVID-19 case
        coughs or sneezes, producing droplets are too heavy to be airborne, they
        land on objects and surfaces surrounding the infected person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can the coronavirus spread via feces?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal
        infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has
        cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have
        been no reports of faecalâˆ’oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to
        date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can asymptomatic patients transmit COVID-19?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Available evidence from contact tracing reported by countries suggests
        that asymptomatically infected individuals are much less likely to
        transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A subset of studies and data shared by some countries on detailed
        cluster investigations and contact tracing activities have reported that
        asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit
        the virus than those who develop symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comprehensive studies on transmission from asymptomatic patients are
        difficult to conduct, as they require testing of large population
        cohorts and more data are needed to better understand and quantified the
        transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. WHO is working with countries around the
        world, and global researchers, to gain better evidence-based
        understanding of the disease as a whole, including the role of
        asymptomatic patients in the transmission of the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can a coronavirus be transmitted from person to person?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person,
        usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a
        household workplace, or health care centre.
